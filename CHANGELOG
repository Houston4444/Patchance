1.3.1 / 2026-02-21
    Patchbay bug fixes.
        CV ports were considered as regular Audio ports until a patchbay refresh
        Some connection were missing in the graph after a pipewire quantum (buffer size) change
        Sometimes the patch could crash if a JACK port disappears when listing JACK ports.

1.3.0 / 2025-10-03
    Qt6 is now the default framework (instead of Qt5).
    
    New dependencies:

    Features:
        Views: you can now use as much views as you want, switching them with Alt+Num

        Arrange: two scripts can be now arrange the graph, "follow the signal chain" or "two rows facing each other"
        Custom Names: Clients and ports are now renamable in the canvas,
            it can optionnally set this name as JACK metadata and auto-export custom names to JACK pretty names.
        Undo/Redo: all box move, wrap/unwrap, hide/restore, arrange, change view events can be undone/redone
        + Many many optimizations to prevent lagging when patchbay is consequent.
