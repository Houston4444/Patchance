Patchance is one more JACK patchbay GUI.
It is a direct alternative to Catia or Patchage.

As RaySession, it is based on the HoustonPatchbay which provides portgroups, wrappable boxes, editable themes and many other nice features.

RaySession users won't find any interest to use Patchance, Patchance is for theses ones who think they don't need a session manager.

It's main goal is to present a simple app for HoustonPatchbay and show the possibility for any python Qt app to implement it easily.
