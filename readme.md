Patchance is one more JACK patchbay GUI for GNU/Linux systems, but it could be adapted to Mac and Windows with little effort.
It is a direct alternative to [Catia](https://github.com/falkTX/Catia) or [Patchage](https://github.com/drobilla/patchage).

As [RaySession](https://github.com/Houston4444/RaySession), it is based on the [HoustonPatchbay](https://github.com/Houston4444/HoustonPatchbay) submodule which provides portgroups, wrappable boxes, editable themes and many other nice features.

__RaySession__ users won't find any interest to use __Patchance__, __Patchance__ is for theses ones who think they don't need this session manager.

It is a simple app for __HoustonPatchbay__ and it shows the possibility for any python Qt app to implement this submodule easily.
